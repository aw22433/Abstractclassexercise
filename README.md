# Abstractclassexercise

Requires python 3
I used the ABC library for abstract classes.

This is a simple program containing 3 abstract methods and one subclass.
Further subclasses can be added with different methods e.g. Current account with no withdrawal restriction, current account which cant be overdrawn, etc.
